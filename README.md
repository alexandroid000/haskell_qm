title: Quantum Mechanics in Haskell
...


Building on the work of [Jan Skibinski](QuantumVector.lhs) and [Jerzy
Karczmarczuk](quantum_mechanics.pdf), we hope to demonstrate how Quantum Systems
may be intuitively built and simulated using the Haskell functional programming
language. Many features of Haskell make it [useful for scientific
computation](scientific_computation.pdf).
